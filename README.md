# Data Structure
Trie

Sparse Table ------ O(NlogN) preprocess  +  O(1) query      for RMQ

Segment Tree ------ O(N)   preprocess  +  O(logN) query     for RMQ

Binary Index Tree ------ O(NlogN) preprocess + O(logN) query + O(n) space for RMQ

Suffix Array / Suffix Tree

Min Stack



# Trick

Rotate Right Shift = Three times reverse

Tree PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder non-recursive traverse

File system is equivalent to multi-way tree (how to judge two file system have same topology?  see "Backup Integrity" problem, in Online Judge Hackrank)

Expectation and Probability

Median is related to minHeap and maxHeap with similar size. (maxHeap stores first half elements, minHeap stores second half)

Computing components can be solved in reverse order by union-find (see ACIM Tryout #1 Problem G Artwork)
